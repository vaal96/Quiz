## General info
Building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice 
questions. This app will run in the browser and
will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS 
powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It will 
have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
AS A coding boot camp student I WANT to take a timed 
quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
